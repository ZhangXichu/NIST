# make all the plots ready
# use NISTv to run the verification tests paralelly
# precalculate the results for the whole data set using the original implemetation
    can't really proceed after 1048573 (prime case), and from n = 1048573, the p_value result begins to deviate 
    - calculate the rest using FFTW
make it possible to run all the tests from test.sh script
# refactor test_mkl_avoid and verify_mkl_avoid
# make the bitmaps using TRNG and rand() function in C
// - add the code demo of FFTSS and KFR to the appendix
// - implement the FFT (only supports 2^k size) and add the code to appendix (no need for adding new stuff)
# - recreate the graph next_primes.pdf (the edge of the original one is cut out)
# - rerun the in-place FFTW (small factor case)
# - change the testing data for SMALL_FACTOR (each should be chosen to be close to the corresponding power of 2)
- rerun the corresponding tests:
    # - precompute the p-values using the original implementation, IPP (cpx), MKL (cpx), FFTW (cpx)
    - params: IPP (hints), MKL (workspace), FFTW (est & mea)
    - in- & out-of-place: IPP (out), MKL (out, in), FFTW (out, in)
    - overview 
        - test FFTS real individually (doesn't support size 2)
- delete the extended data sets category (note necesssary anymore) 
some tasks which might not be necesssary:
    - implement Bluestein algorithm
    - figure out in-place FFT
        -- the results are not completely right
    - try iterative in-place mergesort

FFTW 
    # ESTIMATE (default out-of-place) real: POW2, SMALL_FACTOR, PRIME; cpx: POW2, SMALL_FACTOR, PRIME
    # ESTIMATE in-place real: POW2, SMALL_FACTOR, PRIME; cpx: POW2, SMALL_FACTOR, PRIME
    MEASURE real: # POW2, SMALL_FACTOR, PRIME; cpx: # POW2, SMALL_FACTOR, PRIME
        (very slow)
    # - The graph of placement comparison is not correct for prime case 
    # - Also: change the legend in the graph
    - rerun the tests for multi-theraded FFT on the larger set of data (2 to 2^26)

IPP:
    // in-place (not supported -- make sure of it)
    # out-of-place: real: POW2, SMALL_FACTOR, PRIME; cpx: POW2, SMALL_FACTOR, PRIME
    - change the real transform to CCS format (for the simplicity for retrieving data)

MKL:
    # ALLOW (default out-of-place) real: POW2, SMALL_FACTOR, PRIME; cpx: POW2, SMALL_FACTOR, PRIME
    # ALLOW in-place real: POW2, SMALL_FACTOR, PRIME; cpx: POW2, SMALL_FACTOR, PRIME
    # AVOID real: POW2, SMALL_FACTOR, PRIME; cpx: POW2, SMALL_FACTOR, PRIME
        real PRIME: plot again without the extreme value at point 33554393 and 67108837
        - check why are there the extreme values

The valley in the graph of IPP and MKL (prime case, cpx): explain: padding in Bluestein algorithm
    - plot the distance to the next power of 2
    - check what algorithm does FFTW use to compute the FFT of prime size
